# Red

Some Red content, maybe. You should see the red theme on this page, unless you're ignoring forced themes via the settings, or unless `red` isn't in the `themeConfig.yuu.colorThemes` array in the `/pages/.vuepress/config.js` file.

This page is using a custom layout as a demo, which you can set on a per-page basis.
